# CrimePrediction
Code for comparison and analysis of crime predicition
Criminal activities and violence are a threat to justice and require our utmost efforts to be stopped.
Precise criminal activity prediction and forecasting, and predicting patterns can help to significantly improve safety in metropolitan areas.
Because humans have a limited ability to analyze complex information from large amounts of data, it is difficult to predict and anticipate crime early and effectively. Many computational challenges and opportunities arise from the precise calculation of the type, rate, and hot spots of crime from previous patterns.
Despite extensive study, there is a need for a more powerful predictive algorithm that directs police patrols in the area of criminal activities.
Previous research has demonstrated that crime forecasting and prediction accuracy can be obtained utilizing learning models. As a result, we'll need a fast-paced algorithm to categorize and forecast the next crime.
